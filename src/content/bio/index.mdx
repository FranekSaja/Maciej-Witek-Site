I am a philosopher specializing in pragmatics and the philosophy of language.
My research centers on adopting the Austinian framework to explore phenomena such as accommodation, irony, linguistic underdeterminacy, presuppositions, and meaning negotiation.
My current research interests include an eliminativist perspective in metasemantics, as well as varieties of non-overt speech, including insinuation, strictly covert acts, and 'sneaky’ presuppositions.
