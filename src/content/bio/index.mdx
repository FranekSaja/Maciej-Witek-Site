I am a philosopher specializing in pragmatics and the philosophy of language.
My research centers on adopting the Austinian framework to explore phenomena such as accommodation, irony, linguistic underdeterminacy, presuppositions, and meaning negotiation.
My current research interests include an eliminativist perspective in metasemantics, as well as varieties of non-overt speech, including insinuation, strictly covert acts, and 'sneaky’ presuppositions.

I am a Professor of Philosophy in the <a href="https://en.usz.edu.pl/fik/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Institute of Philosophy and Cognitive Science</a> at the University of Szczecin (Poland), a Life Member of Clare Hall College (Cambridge), and the coordinator of the <a href="http://ccrg.usz.edu.pl" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cognition & Communication Research Group (CCRG)</a>
