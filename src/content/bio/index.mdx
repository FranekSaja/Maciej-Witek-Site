I am a Professor of Philosophy in the <a href="https://en.usz.edu.pl/fik/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Institute of Philosophy and Cognitive Science</a> at the University of Szczecin (Poland), a Life Member of Clare Hall College (Cambridge), and the coordinator of the <a href="http://ccrg.usz.edu.pl" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cognition & Communication Research Group (CCRG)</a>

&nbsp;

My research focuses on pragmatics and the philosophy of language. I develop an Austin-inspired theory of speech acts and use it to explore phenomena such as irony, insinuation, conceptual change, accommodation, linguistic underdeterminacy, language conventions and speech act norms. 

&nbsp;

I am currently preparing a monograph *"Unspoken Meanings: An Essay on Insinuation and Other Forms of Non-Overt Speech and leading a project Lexicalized Concepts from the Perspectives of Meaning Eliminativism and Dynamic Conventionalism: An Austinian Account of Conceptual Change and Amelioration"*, funded by the National Science Centre, Poland (2024/53/B/HS1/00590).
